📖 Usage Guide
Web Application
The main application provides four analysis tabs:

1.Atmosphere Overview: View how temperature, pressure, and density change with altitude

2.Single Point Analysis: Get detailed atmospheric and performance data at specific conditions

3.Performance Curves: See how aircraft performance varies with altitude

4.Thrust-Drag Analysis: Analyze the relationship between velocity and required thrust

Python API
You can also use the core modules directly in your Python code:

 ```python
from src.atmosphere_model import StandardAtmosphere
from src.aircraft_performance import AircraftPerformance

# Create atmosphere model
atm = StandardAtmosphere()

# Get properties at 10,000 meters
properties = atm.get_atmospheric_properties(10000)
print(f"Temperature: {properties['temperature_c']:.2f}°C")
print(f"Density: {properties['density']:.4f} kg/m³")

# Calculate aircraft performance
performance = AircraftPerformance(atm)
metrics = performance.performance_at_condition(10000, 250)
print(f"Required thrust: {metrics['required_thrust']/1000:.2f} kN")
